My 1st Repository

CEO at Lavender's Dream (lavendersdream.com). Hoping to learn and implement neccessary coding for site to perfect performance.
Would love some tips on how to use github for bugfixing and site performance but, I'm completely new to this, so if you have any
tips, please, don't hesitate to share! I have no idea what I'm doing!
